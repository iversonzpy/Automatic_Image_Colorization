# Automatic Image Colorization

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to investigate into the automatic image colorization problem which converts a gray-scale image to a colorful one. We've built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on the recently state-of-art colorization algorithms. In our project, different elements of each paperâ€™s method are combined to do the colorization. We also conducted the experiments with various architectures, loss functions with the goal of producing plausible, natural, vibrant colorizations on grayscale images.
